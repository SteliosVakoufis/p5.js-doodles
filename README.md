# p5.js-doodles
Algorithm based code using p5.js\
\
This repo is a collection of algorithms that I have written about visualizing math equations, physics simulations, search algorithms and other things.\
\
The algorithms are written mainly with pure javascript and the visual aspect is made possible with p5.js
